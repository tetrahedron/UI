# Tetrahedron

Tetrahedron is a React UI library that is built to be as unopinionated and flexible as possible.

## Concepts

- **Nothing should be assumed** about the use-case of any components
- **No values should be hard-coded**, instead, use `defaultProps` so they can be overridden

## Packages

- [Tetrahedron Grid](https://github.com/tetrahedron/grid)
